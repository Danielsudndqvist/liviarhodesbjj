# Lívia Rhodes BJJ


This is an informative website for Lívia Rhodes, a professional athlete from Brazil. The goal with this is to find sponsorships and collaborations with people who want to grow together with her. The page contains some information about who she is and what her dreams and goals are. There is a gallery section where it's possible to see some of her accomplishments during her career. Lastly, we have a contact section where it's possible to send a message to her.




## Features:

On the front page (Home), we have some information about who she is and describe her life and career together with some pictures.

The second page of the site is the Gallery section where we uploaded some of her podium pictures from the last three years and a video reel from a competition.

The third and last page is a contact form where it's possible to send a message to Livia with a text. It's required to write name and email address before submitting the message.
