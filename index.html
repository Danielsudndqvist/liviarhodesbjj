                <h2>About Lívia</h2>
                <p>My name is Lívia Rhodes, and I'm 23 years old from Brazil, currently living in Sweden. 
                    Since the age of twelve, I have been training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. For the last five years, 
                    my main focus in life has been becoming as good as possible and making the sport my full-time job by 
                    competing and teaching. I'm currently a brown belt, which is the last one before black belt. My biggest 
                    dream is to become a world champion in black belt, and I'm currently working hard on getting there, working, 
                    studying, and training at the same time.
                </p>

                    <h2>My life in Brazil</h2>
                    <p>I grew up in a town called Manhuaçu in the state of Minas Gerais. It's a smaller city about eight hours 
                        by car from Rio de Janeiro. When I started chasing my Jiu Jitsu career, I moved to another city called 
                        Vitória and started training at GF Team, which is one of the best teams in Brazil.
                         I was competing a lot and made a lot of improvements with my new team.

                    <h2>My life in Sweden</h2>
                    <p>Year 2022, I got an opportunity to go to Sweden to help out teaching some classes at an academy for three months. 
                        I accepted without thinking about it as I love traveling and always wanted to visit Europe. After a couple of weeks, 
                        I started dating my current boyfriend, and we started to apply for me to stay in Sweden. After a long process and a 
                        lot of traveling in and out of Sweden, I finally got approved in the summer of 2023. I dove straight into language courses, 
                        and I'm speaking Swedish without hindrance already. My club, where I train, is very supportive and does a lot to help me become 
                        a full-time athlete.
                    </p>
